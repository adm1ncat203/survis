  abstract={Electronic health records are used to extract patient's information instantly and remotely, which can help to keep track of patients' due dates for checkups, immunizations, and to monitor health performance. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the USA protects the patient data confidentiality, but it can be used if data is re-identified using `HIPAA Safe Harbor' technique. Usually, this re-identification is performed manually, which is very laborious and time captivating exertion. Various techniques have been proposed for automatic extraction of useful information, and accurate diagnosis of diseases. Most of these methods are based on Machine Learning and Deep Learning Methods, while the auxiliary diagnosis is performed using Rule-based methods. This review focuses on recently published papers, which are categorized into Rule-Based Methods, Machine Learning (ML) Methods, and Deep Learning (DL) Methods. Particularly, ML methods are further categorized into Support Vector Machine Methods (SVM), Bayes Methods, and Decision Tree Methods (DT). DL methods are decomposed into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Autoencoders (AE) methods. The objective of this survey paper is to highlight both the strong and weak points of various proposed techniques in the disease diagnosis. Moreover, we present advantage, disadvantage, focused disease, dataset employed, and publication year of each category.},

  abstract={The majority of clinical data is only available in unstructured text documents. Thus, their automated usage in data-based clinical application scenarios, like quality assurance and clinical decision support by treatment suggestions, is hindered because it requires high manual annotation efforts. In this work, we introduce a system for the automated processing of clinical reports of mamma carcinoma patients that allows for the automatic extraction and seamless processing of relevant textual features. Its underlying information extraction pipeline employs a rule-based grammar approach that is integrated with semantic technologies to determine the relevant information from the patient record. The accuracy of the system, developed with nine thousand clinical documents, reaches accuracy levels of 90% for lymph node status and 69% for the structurally most complex feature, the hormone status.},

  abstract={Urban living in modern large cities has significant adverse effects on health, increasing the risk of several chronic diseases. We focus on the two leading clusters of chronic diseases, heart disease and diabetes, and develop data-driven methods to predict hospitalizations due to these conditions. We base these predictions on the patients' medical history, recent and more distant, as described in their Electronic Health Records (EHRs). We formulate the prediction problem as a binary classification problem and consider a variety of machine learning methods, including kernelized and sparse Support Vector Machines (SVMs), sparse logistic regression, and random forests. To strike a balance between accuracy and interpretability of the prediction, which is important in a medical setting, we propose two novel methods: K -LRT, a likelihood ratio test-based method, and a Joint Clustering and Classification (JCC) method which identifies hidden patient clusters and adapts classifiers to each cluster. We develop theoretical out-of-sample guarantees for the latter method. We validate our algorithms on large data sets from the Boston Medical Center, the largest safety-net hospital system in New England.},

  abstract={Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is an important disease leading to blindness in humans, attracting a lot of research interests. Previous breakthrough research findings rely on deep learning techniques to diagnose diabetic retinopathy in patients with medical imaging. Although the medical imaging achieves reasonable recognition accuracy, the application of mass, easy-to-obtain and free electronic health records (EHR) data in life can make an early diagnosis of the DR more convenient and quick. In this paper, we used a set of five machine learning models to diagnose the DR in patients with the EHR data and formed a set of treatment methods. Our experimental data set is formed by processing the data provided by 301 hospitals. The experimental results show that random forest (RF) in the machine learning model can get 92% accuracy with good performance. Subsequently, the input features were analyzed and their importance graded to find that the predisposing factors triggering the human DR disease were associated with renal and liver function. In addition, disease diagnosis methods based on readily available the EHR data will become an integral part of smart healthcare and mobile healthcare.},

Annotating these codes is labor intensive and error prone; furthermore, the connection between the codes and the text is not annotated, obscuring the reasons and details behind specific diagnoses and treatments. We present an attentional convolutional network that predicts medical codes from clinical text. Our method aggregates information across the document using a convolutional neural network, and uses an attention mechanism to select the most relevant segments for each of the thousands of possible codes. The method is accurate, achieving precision@8 of 0.71 and a Micro-F1 of 0.54, which are both better than the prior state of the art. Furthermore, through an interpretability evaluation by a physician, we show that the attention mechanism identifies meaningful explanations for each code assignment.},

  abstract = { The recent years have witnessed a surge of interests in data analytics with patient Electronic Health Records (EHR). Data-driven healthcare, which aims at effective utilization of big medical data, representing the collective learning in treating hundreds of millions of patients, to provide the best and most personalized care, is believed to be one of the most promising directions for transforming healthcare. EHR is one of the major carriers for make this data-driven healthcare revolution successful. There are many challenges on working directly with EHR, such as temporality, sparsity, noisiness, bias, etc. Thus effective feature extraction, or phenotyping from patient EHRs is a key step before any further applications. In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach for phenotyping from patient EHRs. We first represent the EHRs for every patient as a temporal matrix with time on one dimension and event on the other dimension. Then we build a four-layer convolutional neural network model for extracting phenotypes and perform prediction. The first layer is composed of those EHR matrices. The second layer is a one-side convolution layer that can extract phenotypes from the first layer. The third layer is a max pooling layer introducing sparsity on the detected phenotypes, so that only those significant phenotypes will remain. The fourth layer is a fully connected softmax prediction layer. In order to incorporate the temporal smoothness of the patient EHR, we also investigated three different temporal fusion mechanisms in the model: early fusion, late fusion and slow fusion. Finally the proposed model is validated on a real world EHR data warehouse under the specific scenario of predictive modeling of chronic diseases. },

  title={Predicting the Risk of Heart Failure With EHR Sequential Data Modeling},

  volume={6},

  series={IEEE},
  abstract={Electronic health records (EHRs) contain patient diagnostic records, physician records, and records of hospital departments. For heart failure, we can obtain mass unstructured data from EHR time series. By analyzing and mining these time-based EHRs, we can identify the links between diagnostic events and ultimately predict when a patient will be diagnosed. However, it is difficult to use the existing EHR data directly, because they are sparse and non-standardized. Thus, this paper proposes an effective and robust architecture for heart failure prediction. The main contribution of this paper is to predict heart failure using a neural network (i.e., to predict the possibility of cardiac illness based on patient's electronic medical data). Specifically, we employed one-hot encoding and word vectors to model the diagnosis events and predicted heart failure events using the basic principles of a long short-term memory network model. Evaluations based on a real-world data set demonstrate the promising utility and efficacy of the proposed architecture in the prediction of the risk of heart failure.},

  abstract = {With the rapid growth of biomedical and healthcare data, machine learning methods are used in more and more work to predict disease risk. However, most works use single-mode data to predict disease risk and only few works use multimodal data to predict disease risk. Thus, a new multimodal data-based recurrent convolutional neural network (MD-RCNN) for disease risk prediction is proposed. This model not only can use patient’s structured data and text data, but also can extract structured and unstructured features in fine-grained. Furthermore, in order to obtain the highly non-linear relationships between structured data and unstructured data, we use deep belief network (DBN)to fuse the features. Finally, we experiment with the medical big data of a Chinese two grade hospital during 2013–2015. Experimental results show that the accuracy of MD-RCNN algorithm can reaches 96% and outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.}

  abstract={Deep learning (DL)-based predictive models from electronic health records (EHRs) deliver impressive performance in many clinical tasks. Large training cohorts, however, are often required by these models to achieve high accuracy, hindering the adoption of DL-based models in scenarios with limited training data. Recently, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) and related models have achieved tremendous successes in the natural language processing domain. The pretraining of BERT on a very large training corpus generates contextualized embeddings that can boost the performance of models trained on smaller datasets. Inspired by BERT, we propose Med-BERT, which adapts the BERT framework originally developed for the text domain to the structured EHR domain. Med-BERT is a contextualized embedding model pretrained on a structured EHR dataset of 28,490,650 patients. Fine-tuning experiments showed that Med-BERT substantially improves the prediction accuracy, boosting the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) by 1.21–6.14% in two disease prediction tasks from two clinical databases. In particular, pretrained Med-BERT obtains promising performances on tasks with small fine-tuning training sets and can boost the AUC by more than 20% or obtain an AUC as high as a model trained on a training set ten times larger, compared with deep learning models without Med-BERT. We believe that Med-BERT will benefit disease prediction studies with small local training datasets, reduce data collection expenses, and accelerate the pace of artificial intelligence aided healthcare.},

  abstract={Electronic health records (EHR) represent a holistic overview of patients’ trajectories. Their increasing availability has fueled new hopes to leverage them and develop accurate risk prediction models for a wide range of diseases. Given the complex interrelationships of medical records and patient outcomes, deep learning models have shown clear merits in achieving this goal. However, a key limitation of current study remains their capacity in processing long sequences, and long sequence modelling and its application in the context of healthcare and EHR remains unexplored. Capturing the whole history of medical encounters is expected to lead to more accurate predictions, but the inclusion of records collected for decades and from multiple resources can inevitably exceed the receptive field of the most existing deep learning architectures. This can result in missing crucial, long-term dependencies. To address this gap, we present Hi-BEHRT, a hierarchical Transformer-based model that can significantly expand the receptive field of Transformers and extract associations from much longer sequences. Using a multimodal large-scale linked longitudinal EHR, the Hi-BEHRT exceeds the state-of-the-art deep learning models 1% to 5% for area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve and 1% to 8% for area under the precision recall (AUPRC) curve on average, and 2% to 8% (AUROC) and 2% to 11% (AUPRC) for patients with long medical history for 5-year heart failure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and stroke risk prediction. Additionally, because pretraining for hierarchical Transformer is not well-established, we provide an effective end-to-end contrastive pre-training strategy for Hi-BEHRT using EHR, improving its transferability on predicting clinical events with relatively small training dataset.},
